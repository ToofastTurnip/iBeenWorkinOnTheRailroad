I work in Global Real Estate using mostly java along with a few other technologies.
Are you possibly interested in a position at JP Morgan?  Why?
How would you rate your knowlege on software development?

Whiteboard questions:
1. Reverse a string
2. Reverse the words in a string but not the order of the words
3. Print a fibonnachi sequence
4. Write a regular expression for matching a 4-digit pin "^(\\d{4})$"

Conceptual questions:
1. What makes java so special?  Why use java over other technologies?
2. Can you have more than one main method in a class?
3. Let's say I have a database with a trillion entries.  What's the fastest way to iterate through it?
